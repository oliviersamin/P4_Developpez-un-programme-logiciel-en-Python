"""
Project 4 of OpenClassRooms Cursus:
DÃ©veloppez un programme logiciel en Python
From the specs file the Tournament is going through the following steps:
1 - the user creates a new tournament (enter data ...)
2 - the user add 8 players (enter data fore each one)
3 - program generates pairs of players to create matches
4 - At the end of the round ( = end of all matches) user enter the scores
5 - Repeat 3 & 4 until tournament is over

Needed features:
1- save and/or load at any time in between user interaction with program the state of the tournament
2 - generate the following reports:
    a - list of all actors (by alphabetical order or rank)
    b - list of all players of a tournament (by alphabetical order or rank)
    c - List of all tournaments
    d - list of all the rounds of one tournament
    e - list of all matches of one tournament

Generate pairs of players using swiss system:
1 - at the beginning of a tournament class all players with their rank
2 - Divide all the players in the half (half up and half down).
The best of half up is paired with the best of half down and so forth and so on (1 with 5, 2 with 6...)
3 - next round sort the players with their total number of points.
If necessary sort them again with their rank.
